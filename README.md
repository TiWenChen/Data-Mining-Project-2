# Data-Mining-Project-2

This project is part of the Data Mining course at National Taiwan University. The mission is to predict the number of views on a social media platform using structured data as features, along with unstructured data such as images and titles. I discovered that behavioral features, such as the number of tags, the contribution of subcategories, and the number of posts, etc., are significantly correlated with the number of views. Additionally, considering the images and unstructured features together will enhance the accuracy of the prediction.
